Everyone has seen videos of our solar system in 2D. Some of us may have even experienced it in AR. But have you ever experienced our Galaxy in VR??
If not, then you are at the right place.

I introduce to you my VR project to visualize our solar system and space in VR (demo). This project is currently in development mode (cause I am very lazy). I have created a demo of Jupiter planet and some asteroids revolving around it. 

Specs: 
  - Unreal Engine is used for making the project.
  - Assets have been used from the listed website - https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/
  - Photoshop is used for making normal maps.
  - The asteroid belt is made using blueprints and some simple C++ fundamentals.

Running the project:
  - The files of the project are in the drive link.
  - Copy the folder in your device and run the "Space_tut" .uproject file.
  - NOTE: You need to have all the folders in a single folder where you are copying to run the project.
  - When the project opens in Unreal, open the Space level to see the project.
  - In order for VR preview, you need to have correct plugins enabled for your device (I have tested the project on Meta Quest 2).
  - Explore the vast galaxy and enjoy!
